Ways to make money. (INNOVATIVE)
Gangsters - Reliant on Boss, sells drugs to boss
Citizens - ???
Mayor - Fixed
Police - Varible depending on if the mayor likes who they arrest. (THEY LOSE/GAIN MONEY IF THE MAYOR DIS/LIKES THEIR ARRESTS)
Mob Boss - Gangsters gets paid near nothing without, Mob Boss buys drugs, then pays gangster a share. (if gang doesn't get enough, they can assassinate)
GunDealer - SELLS GUNS LOL
Maybe make restrictions which make citizen a prefered class but other classes more lucrative?
